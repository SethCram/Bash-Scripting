# File: Rm_Underscores.sh
#
# Goal:
#  Write a script to change file names: file_1.cpp â†’ file1.cpp
#   remove any/all underscores in C/C++ files in a directory.
#
# Project Description:
#  A directory is passed in when the script is run. It errors if less than
#   one argument or a directory wasn't passed in. Otherwise, all C/C++ 
#   file names within that directory have their underscores removed. 
#
# Clarifications:
#  This program assumes that every file extension that starts with c or C
#   is a C/C++ file. Header Files aren't considered C/ C++ files. Any naming
#   conflicts are resolved by overwriting the pre-existing file.
#
# Possible Expansion:
#  Could prompt user for action w/ overwriting a file with the same name.
